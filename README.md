# Gold Price Volatility Analysis System

## Project Overview
The **Gold Price Volatility Analysis System** aims to analyze and predict fluctuations in gold prices using financial and economic data, along with sentiment analysis. By combining historical gold price data, financial indicators, and sentiment analysis from news and reports, the system will provide insights into significant price movements.

## Project Workflow
### Week 1: Data Collection and Exploration
- **Data Collection:**
  - Gather historical gold price data and economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, inflation) using Yahoo Finance API.
  - Collect sentiment data from news articles or reports via NLP-based APIs (e.g., Google News API, GDELT).
- **Data Exploration:**
  - Analyze datasets for structure, types, missing values, and statistics.
  - Visualize initial trends in price and sentiment.

### Week 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Data Cleaning:** Remove outliers using IQR and handle missing data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features based on sentiment analysis and economic indicators.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Perform correlation and stationarity tests.
- **Visualization:** Develop time-series plots, heatmaps, and interactive dashboards.

### Week 3: Machine Learning Model Development
- **Model Selection:** Test models like ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, and Prophet for forecasting.
- **Model Training:** Train models using historical and sentiment data, with cross-validation.
- **Evaluation & Optimization:** Use metrics (MSE, MAE, RÂ²) and hyperparameter tuning for improvement.

### Week 4: Deployment and Final Presentation
- **Deployment:** Build a web application (using Flask/Streamlit) for users to interact with predictions and visualizations.
- **Final Report:** Deliver a report and presentation summarizing data insights, models, and results.
